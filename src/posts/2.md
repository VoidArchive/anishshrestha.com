Let's solve Leetcode with rust.
I am starting this series with an easy question as I am a total beginner as rust and goal is learn the concept of rust as much as possible.

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

There are lots of way to solve this problem but the best way is to use a hashset.

But the goal of this post is for me to learn rust and DSA, killing two bird with one stone. Therefore I will try to solve using three ways.

1. Brute force solution.
2. Sorting solution
3. Hashset

1. Brute force solution

The easiest way that we can solve this problem is by brute forcing it, that is checking every number in the array to see if its equal with each other. If it is, we return true. If not we return false.

```rust 

fn contains_duplicate(nums: Vec<i32>) -> bool {
    for i in 0..nums.len() {
        for j in i..nums.len() - 1 {
            if nums[i] == nums[j + 1] {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    false
}

```

Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$

Space complexity: $O(1)$

This works, but is really a bad solution.
So bad that if you submit this on leetcode, it shows time limit exceeded

1. Sorting Way

Our next solution is to sort the array, then check the adjacent number to see if its duplicate.

```rust

fn contains_duplicate(mut nums: Vec<i32>) -> bool {
    nums.sort();
    for i in 0..nums.len() - 1 {
        if nums[i] == nums[i + 1] {
            return true;
        }
    }
    false
}

```

Time complexity: $O(nlogn)$ 
Space complexity: $O(1)$

Thankfully, this is accepted on leetcode

But we are only 18.99% faster than other. Obviously we can do better than that. 

3. Hashset solution

```rust

fn contains_duplicate(nums: &Vec<i32>) -> bool {
    let mut a = vec![];
    for i in nums {
        if a.contains(&i) {
            return true;
        }
        a.push(i);
    }
    false
}
```
Time complexity: $O(n)$ 
Space complexity: $O(n)$


This is the most optimal solution. 
	
As someone coming from python seeing impl tags threw me of as I don't



As a developer it's always important to keep learning new stuff. And seeing rust as the most loved language by developer in the stack overflow survey. I had to learn it. 

If you are just here for the solution you can go here.

The goal of this series is to do 150 leetcode question in rust.


**I am a complete beginner at rust, so if you found any mistake or I am wrong, then please let me know**

This is not a guide for learning data structures and algorithm, this is me failing and learning rust by trying to solve leetcode question by doing it in the wrong way. If you are here for just the solution. The below code is the most optimize way to solve this problem. 

```rust

use std::collections::HashSet;

impl Solution {
    pub fn contains_duplicate(nums: Vec<i32>) -> bool {
        let mut a = HashSet::new();
        for i in nums{
            if a.contains(&i){return true}
            a.insert(i);
        }
        false
    }
}
```


Time complexity: $O(n)$ 
Space complexity: $O(n)$

I don't think you can get better than that.
Now that that's out of the way, Let's try to understand this code.
First we are importing HashSet from std::collection using the [Use declarations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/use-declarations.html). [Std::collection](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html) is the standard library of rust that provides efficient implementations of the most common general purpose programming data structures. So stuff like HashMap, HashSet, LinkedList and so on.

The first thing that I noticed when looking at the boiler plate that leetcode gives was the Vec<i32> syntax. 
The hell is that?
According to the amazing rust documentation Vec is a contiguous growable array type, written as `Vec<T>`, short for ‘vector’.  So basically an array that stores data on the heap and is grow-able unlike array which are stored in stack and are fixed in size. 

So the first thing that pop in my mind was what if I use a vector or an array instead of hashset to check if the array contains any duplicates. Well not array because its fixed in size and we can't add new value in it.

Running this code i got an error saying
![[Pasted image 20220818151536.png]]

A bit googling and found that you have to use push instead of insert if you want to add value in the vector whereas insert takes 2 arguments index and the element. 
Run the code again and it works.
![[Pasted image 20220818152145.png]]
But that's slow af. 
It's probably because I am trying to use the Vector as a set, and checking for the existence of an elements  before adding it, then filling the vector which becomes an $O(n^2)$  operation, compared with $O(n)$ for HashSet.

How about we go even slower :v
The good old brute force way where we check each number with rest of the elements. The time complexity of this solution would be $O(n^2)$ but since we are not using any additional memory the space complexity would be $O(1)$  

Hell yeah, we have finally reached our goal.

I think we have peaked here, I can't think of any way to make this even worse. Even though leetcode accept this solution it's slow and also takes additional memory making the space complexity $O(n)$. That's worse than the brute force way.

Let's make it a bit worse by solving it using the sort method. I wonder which sorting method rust use

![[Pasted image 20220818162647.png]]

Oh look at this, rust making my life easy giving me it's time complexity. It even suggest using sort_unstable for a faster sort. But since we are actually trying to make this slower for now I will stick with the stable one.
