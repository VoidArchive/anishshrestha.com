# Setting Up Cloudflare WARP on Arch Linux

Cloudflare WARP is more than just a VPNâ€”it's a modern approach to secure, fast internet connectivity. Unlike traditional VPNs that route all your traffic through distant servers, WARP leverages Cloudflare's global network to provide faster, more reliable connections while maintaining privacy.

## What is Cloudflare WARP?

WARP offers several modes of operation:

- **DNS-only mode**: Fast, secure DNS resolution without VPN tunneling
- **WARP mode**: Full VPN protection through Cloudflare's network
- **WARP + DoH**: VPN with DNS-over-HTTPS for maximum security

## Installation on Arch Linux

The easiest way to install WARP on Arch Linux is through the AUR (Arch User Repository).

### Install from AUR

If you're using an AUR helper like `yay` or `paru`:

```bash
# Using yay
yay -S cloudflare-warp-bin

# Using paru
paru -S cloudflare-warp-bin

# Manual installation
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/cloudflare-warp-bin.git
cd cloudflare-warp-bin
makepkg -si
```

The `cloudflare-warp-bin` package provides the `warp-cli` command-line interface for managing your WARP connection.

## Initial Setup and Registration

After installation, you need to register your device with Cloudflare:

```bash
# Register a new device
warp-cli registration new
```

This command:

- Creates a unique device identifier
- Generates cryptographic keys for your device
- Registers your device with Cloudflare's servers
- Downloads initial configuration

The registration is **free** and doesn't require a Cloudflare account, though having one enables additional features.

## Understanding WARP Modes

WARP offers flexible operation modes depending on your privacy and performance needs.

### Check Current Mode

```bash
warp-cli mode
```

This displays your current operating mode and available options.

### Available Modes

#### 1. Full VPN Mode (`warp`)

```bash
warp-cli mode -- warp
```

**What it does:**

- Routes all your traffic through Cloudflare's network
- Encrypts all data between your device and Cloudflare
- Changes your apparent IP address
- Provides maximum privacy protection

**When to use:** When you need full VPN protection, especially on untrusted networks.

#### 2. VPN + DNS over HTTPS (`warp+doh`)

```bash
warp-cli mode -- warp+doh
```

**What it does:**

- Combines full VPN protection with DNS-over-HTTPS
- Encrypts both your traffic and DNS queries
- Prevents DNS snooping and manipulation
- Provides the highest security level

**When to use:** Maximum security scenarios, public Wi-Fi, or regions with DNS censorship.

#### 3. DNS-Only Mode (`doh`)

```bash
warp-cli mode -- doh
```

**What it does:**

- Only routes DNS queries through Cloudflare
- Doesn't change your IP address
- Faster than full VPN mode
- Still provides DNS privacy and security

**When to use:** When you want faster DNS resolution and privacy without VPN overhead.

#### 4. Disabled (`off`)

```bash
warp-cli mode -- off
```

**What it does:**

- Completely disables WARP
- Returns to your system's default networking
- Useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues

## Connecting and Managing WARP

### Start Your Connection

After setting your preferred mode:

```bash
warp-cli connect
```

This command:

- Establishes connection based on your selected mode
- Configures network routing
- Begins protecting your traffic

### Verify Connection Status

```bash
warp-cli status
```

**Example output:**

```
Status update: Connected
Success: 192.0.2.1

# For more detailed information
warp-cli settings
```

### Disconnect When Needed

```bash
warp-cli disconnect
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom DNS Settings

You can configure custom DNS servers even in WARP mode:

```bash
# Set custom DNS (example: Quad9)
warp-cli dns families malware

# Reset to Cloudflare DNS
warp-cli dns families off
```

### Exclude Applications

Some applications might not work well with WARP. You can exclude them:

```bash
# Exclude specific applications
warp-cli exclude add "application-name"

# List excluded applications
warp-cli exclude list

# Remove exclusions
warp-cli exclude remove "application-name"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Problems

If WARP fails to connect:

```bash
# Check current status
warp-cli status

# Reset registration
warp-cli registration delete
warp-cli registration new

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart warp-svc
```

### Performance Issues

For slow connections:

1. Try DNS-only mode first: `warp-cli mode -- doh`
2. Check for conflicting VPN software
3. Verify firewall isn't blocking WARP

### Network Conflicts

If you experience connectivity issues:

```bash
# Temporarily disable
warp-cli disconnect

# Test without WARP
# If issues persist, problem isn't WARP-related

# Re-enable
warp-cli connect
```

## Why WARP on Arch Linux?

**Performance Benefits:**

- Cloudflare's global network often provides faster connections than traditional VPNs
- Argo Smart Routing optimizes paths to destinations
- No bandwidth limitations on the free tier

**Privacy Advantages:**

- Prevents ISP tracking and logging
- Encrypts traffic on untrusted networks
- DNS queries are encrypted and not logged

**Arch Linux Integration:**

- Lightweight CLI tool fits Arch's philosophy
- No heavy GUI applications required
- Easy to script and automate

## Automation and Scripting

You can automate WARP management with systemd or shell scripts:

```bash
# Create a simple toggle script
#!/bin/bash
STATUS=$(warp-cli status | grep "Status update" | cut -d' ' -f3)

if [ "$STATUS" = "Connected" ]; then
    warp-cli disconnect
    echo "WARP disconnected"
else
    warp-cli connect
    echo "WARP connected"
fi
```

## Conclusion

Cloudflare WARP provides an excellent balance of privacy, performance, and simplicity on Arch Linux. Its multiple operation modes let you choose the right level of protection for each situation, from simple DNS security to full VPN protection.

The CLI interface aligns perfectly with Arch Linux's philosophy, giving you full control without unnecessary complexity. Whether you're protecting your privacy on public Wi-Fi or just want faster, more secure DNS resolution, WARP is a valuable addition to your networking toolkit.
