# Hello, World!

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a test to demonstrate how **MDsvex** works with SvelteKit.

## What is MDsvex?

MDsvex allows you to write Svelte components directly in your Markdown files. It's perfect for creating interactive blog posts with the simplicity of Markdown and the power of Svelte.

## Some Cool Features

- **Markdown syntax** for easy writing
- **Svelte components** for interactivity  
- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- **Frontmatter** for metadata

### Code Example

Here's some Go code (my favorite language):

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go!")
    
    // Simple function
    result := add(5, 3)
    fmt.Printf("5 + 3 = %d\n", result)
}

func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

### Python Example

And some Python for data processing:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate fibonacci sequence up to n terms."""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
    
    return sequence

# Generate first 10 fibonacci numbers
fib_numbers = fibonacci(10)
print(f"First 10 fibonacci numbers: {fib_numbers}")
```

## My Philosophy

As mentioned in my bio, I believe most software is **overengineered**. I prioritize:

1. **Predictable performance** over clever abstractions
2. **Radical minimalism** in frontend development
3. **Go** for distributed systems
4. **Python** for data-heavy workloads

And yes, I use **vim** btw. ðŸ˜„
