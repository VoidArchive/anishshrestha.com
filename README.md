A personal portfolio and interactive coding laboratory built to explore the boundaries of web development and algorithm implementation.

## Why I Built This

This project exists as a playground for experimentation—to see how much I can build, learn, and push the limits of modern web technologies. It's my sandbox for exploring complex algorithms, game AI, visualization techniques, and creative coding challenges.

Every lab, every algorithm, and every interaction represents a learning opportunity. From implementing minimax algorithms to building custom animation engines, this portfolio is a testament to curiosity-driven development and the joy of solving interesting problems.

## Features

### Interactive Algorithm Labs

- **Bagchal**: Traditional Nepali board game with AI opponent using minimax algorithm and opening books
- **DSA Visualizer**: Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Merge, Heap) and pathfinding (A\*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS)
- **Conway's Game of Life**: Cellular automaton simulation with pattern library and real-time statistics
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Classic game with unbeatable AI implementation

### Technical Architecture

- **Modular Game Engine**: Abstracted BaseEngine system for rapid game development
- **Reusable AI Framework**: Minimax implementations with alpha-beta pruning
- **Custom Animation Engine**: State management system for algorithm visualization
- **Component Architecture**: Clean, maintainable Svelte 5 components

### Development Stack

- **SvelteKit 5** with Server-Side Rendering
- **TypeScript** for type safety throughout
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for consistent styling
- **Cloudflare Workers** deployment
- **MDsveX** for technical blog integration
